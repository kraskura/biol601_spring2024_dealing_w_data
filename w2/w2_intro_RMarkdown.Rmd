```{r setup, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE}

```

## Getting started:

R markdown can nicely combine writing and executing R script and making extensive notes. 

### 1. Examples of text formatting:

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6

-   6 level headers, serve as internal ouline links (toc)
-   *italics*\
-   **bold**
-   `code`
-   another bullet point
    -   second level bullet point
-   [links](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.HTML)

### 2. Code Chunks:

```{r libraries, messages = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='hide', echo = FALSE}
# loading necessary libraries 
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
# library(kableExtra) # great package for html tables, will not work for pdf and word exports
```

```{r libraries and here2, eval= TRUE, echo=T, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, messages=FALSE, results='hide'}

## OPTION 1 (be sure to add eval = FALSE if not running this)

# using library "here"
here::here() # sets the root directory

data <- read.csv(here("w2","dfexample.csv")) # read in data, inside 'here()' we write the path to our data from the root directory (e.g., w1 is a folder that holds the csv file)

# to see the parent folder:
# here()

```

```{r libraries and here, messages = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='hide', echo =T, eval = FALSE}

## OPTION 2 (be sure to add eval = FALSE if not running this)

# rename it to match your working directory
setwd("/Users/kristakraskura/Github_repositories/biol601_spring2024_dealing_w_data/w2/")

data <- read.csv("dfexample.csv") # read in data

```

Some useful settings for the code chunks:

-   `include = FALSE` prevents code and results from appearing in the
    finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the
    results can be used by other chunks.
-   `echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in
    the finished file.
-   `results = 'hide' or FALSE` prevents the results to be shown. Useful
    when
-   `message = FALSE` prevents messages that are generated by code from
    appearing in the finished file.
-   `warning = FALSE` prevents warnings that are generated by code from
    appearing in the finished.
-   `fig.width =` the width of the printed figure, in inches
-   `fig.height =` the height of the printed figure, in inches

(click tab in the section to see all the options)

### 3. Images (not figures):

-   Use `knitr::include_graphics()`

```{r insert figure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics("snail.jpeg") # place the image in the same folder as the rmd file

```

### 4. Tables:

`kable` in `knitr` works well for html, pdf, and word document outputs. 

```{r}
  
knitr::kable(data, # data frame
             digits = 2, # round to 2 digits 
             col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(data)),# format column names, substitute the dots with spaces
             align = "c", # alignment center 
             longtable = TRUE) # formats tables that span multiple pages

```



### 5. Figures made using imbedded script:

```{r snail data figures, fig.cap="Figure 1. Snail body sizes along the transect position", fig.width=7.5, fig.height=5}

# plot code from week 1:
	ggplot(data = data, aes(x = transect.position, y = snail.size)) +
	  geom_point(aes(col = substrate.type)) +
	  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
	        axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),
	        text = element_text(size = 20)) +
	  scale_x_continuous(name = "Transect position (m)", breaks = seq(-10, 20, by =2)) +
	  scale_y_continuous(name = "Snail size (mm)", breaks = seq(-10, 40, by = 5))
	

```

### Rendering and customization of the file

-   pick a theme, or stick with a default
-   render to PDF or html (some themes will not work to PDF)
-   html (most common)
-   table of contents
-   execute the code in R markdown and show out put in R markdown is the
    default. To change that go to 'settings' (next to the knit) and
    select 'chunk output in Console'
